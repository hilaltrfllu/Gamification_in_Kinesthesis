# Gamification_in_Kinesthesis
This project was designed and implemented to help patients that got chronical ankle instability and needs routine daily theurapatic exercises. A game was developed for the exercises and a website was developed for the physiotherapists to monitor the patient data remotely. A hardware named Nintendo Wii Balance Board is used as a joystick in the game. It's working principle is based on weight measurement from the 4 sensors under the board. The weight data was converted into space axis to ensure the user movement on the game. A plugin named WiiBuddy which is obtained from Unity Asset Store is used to obtain patient data. Firstly, user must sign up and log in on gui to play the game. A few database operations works on the background while user tries to log in or sign up to the system. After the operations, if user's attempt is successful, she/he accesses to the game and play the game using Nintendo Wii Balance Board. Then the user data sends to the server with the HTTP protocol to save into the database and website gets data and displays in a table.
